procedure A

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

procedure B

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))

Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5). Are these processes iterative or recursive?

(+ 4 5)

> A
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9

As we can see in the substitution of the arguments for the parameters to procedure A, this process is recursive, as it defers the increments to make proportionally to the parameter ``a''.


> B
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9

As we can see in the substitution of the arguments fo the parameters to procedure B, this process is iterative, as the size of deferred operations doesn't grow, because inc and dec can be evaluated immediately and return new primitives as the arguments to the recursive procedure.
