conjecture: a generic formula for number of remainders given by the gcd.scm procedure is defined by the following formula:

r(n) = Fib(n+1) - 1 + sum(from i to n) (Fib(i+2) - 1)

r(0) = 0
r(1) = 1
r(2) = 4
r(3) = 9
r(4) = 18
r(5) = 33
.
.
.

To calculate this, observing that each if statement has the number of remainder calls of the two previous calls plus a new call to combine the two previous calls, where the 0th and 1st call are 0 and 1 respectively.

This can be modeled by 

r(n) = Fibm(n) + Fibm(n-1) + sum(i=1 to n-1)(Fibm(n-1))
     = Fibm(n-1) + sum(i=1 to n)(Fibm(i))
     
where Fibm(x) = 1 + Fibm(x-1) + Fibm(x-2), Fibm(0) = 0, Fibm(1) = 1

Observing that Fibm(n) follows Fib(n+1) + Fib(n) it can be shown that Fibm(n) = Fib(n+1) + Fib(n) - 1

by induction.

Substituting the Fib value for the Fibm value, we end up with:

r(n) = Fib(n+1) - 1 + sum(1 to i=n)(Fib(i+2) - 1)
