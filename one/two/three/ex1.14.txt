really good mathematical analysis of ex1.14 to work through in more detail (https://www.ysagade.nl/2015/04/12/sicp-change-growth/).

Space is theta(n) since we will only ever call one branch of the tree to its maximum depth before returning a value and recursing the value back and proceeding down another branch of the tree.

Time is theta(n) for reasons shown in the analysis above.  Essentially, the left branch is called theta(n^(k-1)) times, which is called theta(n) times (actual number of calls depends on denominations of coins).  Thus, we arrive at theta(n^k) time complexity.
