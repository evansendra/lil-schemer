The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal's triangle.

        1
      1   1
    1   2   1
  1   3   3  1
1   4   6   4   1


The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it. Write a procedure that computes elements of Pascal's triangle by means of a recursive process.

I'll assume that for the purpose of this problem Pascal's triangle is enumerated as in the below, whereby the 13th number is 6, for example:

        1
       2   3
     4   5   6
   7   8   9  10
11   12   13   14   15

Therefore, calling (pascal n) where n=3 would result in 1; (pascal 5) 2; (pascal 9) 3, and so on...
