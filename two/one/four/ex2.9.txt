Exercise 2.9.  The width of an interval is half of the difference between its upper and lower bounds. The width is a measure of the uncertainty of the number specified by the interval. For some arithmetic operations the width of the result of combining two intervals is a function only of the widths of the argument intervals, whereas for others the width of the combination is not a function of the widths of the argument intervals. Show that the width of the sum (or difference) of two intervals is a function only of the widths of the intervals being added (or subtracted). Give examples to show that this is not true for multiplication or division.

What would it mean for an arithmetic operation on internvals to be a "function of" the width of the argument intervals?
f(Wa, Wb) = y -> the function f specifying some arithmetic operation should map to some y which is the same for given interval width arguments Wa, Wb

To show that the width of the sum and difference of two intervals is a function only of the widths of the intervals being added or subtracted, we can prove for addition that this is true and because subtraction can be defined as in `sub-interval-alt` above in terms of addition, this will prove also subtraction.

Addition explicitly uses terms of the line segment (upper and lower) that are the same as those used to construct the widths.
Wa = (Ua - La) / 2, Wb = (Ub - Lb) / 2
f(a,b) where f is addition 
f(a,b) = (La+Lb,Ua+Ub)
Wa+b where ab is the given result above
Wa+b = ((Ua+Ub) - (La+Lb)) / 2
Rearranging terms, we can put this in terms of Wa, Wb
Wa+b = (Ua-La) / 2 + (Ub - Lb) / 2 = Wa + Wb

We defined `sub-interval-alt` in terms of addition, so we can plug those numbers in and see how this is still a function of widths

So it holds that for addition and subtraction, Wa+b = Wa + Wb and Wa-b = Wa - Wb

To show that for multiplication and division, this is not the case, we simply must show that there exist

f(Wa, Wb) = y and f(Wa', Wb') = z where f is multiplication and Wa = Wa' and Wb = Wb', but a and a' are different (as well as b and b')

I 
a = (0,1); b = (1,5)
Wa = 0.5, Wb = 2
a*b = (min(0, 0, 1, 5), max(0, 0, 1, 5))
a*b = (0, 5)
Wa*b = 2.5

II
a = (2, 3); b = (10, 14)
Wa = 0.5, Wb = 2
a*b = (min(20, 28, 30, 42), max(20, 28, 30, 42))
a*b = (20, 42)
Wa*b = 11

I: f(0.5,2) = 2.5
II: f(20,42) = 11
Thus the width of multiplied line segments cannot be a function of input widths.  The same holds for division as its input is the multiplication of line segments.
