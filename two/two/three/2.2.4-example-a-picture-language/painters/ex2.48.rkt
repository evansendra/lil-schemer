;Exercise 2.48: A directed line segment in the plane can be represented as a pair of vectorsâ€”the vector running from the origin to the start-point of the segment, and the vector running from the origin to the end-point of the segment. Use your vector representation from Exercise 2.46 to de- fine a representation for segments with a constructor make- segment and selectors start-segment and end-segment.

(define (make-segment x1 y1 x2 y2) (cons (make-vect x1 y1) (make-vect x2 y2)))
(define (start-segment s) (car s))
(define (end-segment s) (cdr s))
